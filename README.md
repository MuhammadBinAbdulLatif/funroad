## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (App Router)

- **tRPC** (API layer)
- **Payload CMS** (as backend/database)
- **Zod** (schema validation)
- **React Hook Form** (form management)
- **Radix UI** (UI primitives)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **Sonner** (toast notifications)
- **Lucide React** (icons)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Yarn or npm
- MongoDB (for Payload CMS)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadBinAbdulLatif/funroad.git
   cd funroad
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values (MongoDB URI, etc).

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Access the app:**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Project Structure
- `/components` - React UI components (forms, sidebar, etc)
- `/Server` - tRPC procedures and backend logic
- `/trpc` - tRPC client/server setup
- `/types` - Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- `/public` - Static assets (images, etc)

## Development Notes
- Uses tRPC for type-safe API calls between frontend and backend.
- Category filtering is recursive: selecting a category shows products in all its subcategories.
- Uses Payload CMS for data storage and admin.
- UI is built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for accessibility and rapid styling.
